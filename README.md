# Using Python to create GeoBlacklight Metadata 

## Geo4LibCamp2020 Geospatial Metadata Workshop

### Activities
- Introduce the GeoBlacklight schema and OpenGeoMetadata
- Review examples of local customizations for the GeoBlacklight schema
- Run simple Python scripts that transform metadata file formats between JSON and CSV
- Run Python scripts for extracting GeoBlacklight values from a different metadata schema
- Discuss workflows for harvesting records from open data portals

### Tools required
- A laptop with Python 3 installed
- Spreadsheet editor
- Jupyter Notebook
- We will be using Jupyter Notebook to edit and run the scripts. Information on installing Jupyter for your computer can be found here: https://jupyter.org/install
- If you have multiple versions of Python installed, this documentation may help you make sure Jupyter Notebook is running on Python 3.

Python scripting skills are NOT required for this workshop. Any participant with a working installation of Python 3 should be able to complete the activities.
