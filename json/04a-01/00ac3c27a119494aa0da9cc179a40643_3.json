  "dc_description_s": "This is a MD iMAP hosted service layer. Find more information at http://imap.maryland.gov.Roadway Maintenance Responsibility data consists of linear geometric features which specifically show the government agencies responsible for maintain roadways throughout the State of Maryland. Roadway Maintenance Responsibility data is primarily used for general planning and road maintenance coordination purposes, and for Federal Highway Administration (FHWA) Highway Performance Monitoring System (HPMS) annual submission coordination. The Maryland Department of Transportation State Highway Administration (MDOT SHA) currently reports this data only on the ing publicinventory direction (generally North or East) side of the roadway. Roadway Maintenance Responsibility data is not a complete representation of all roadway geometry.Roadway Maintenance Responsibility data is developed as part of the Highway Performance Monitoring System (HPMS) which maintains and reports transportation related information to the Federal Highway Administration (FHWA) on an annual basis. HPMS is maintained by the Maryland Department of Transportation State Highway Administration (MDOT SHA), under the Office of Planning and Preliminary Engineering (OPPE) Data Services Division (DSD). Roadway Maintenance Responsibility data is used by various business units throughout MDOT, as well as many other Federal, State and local government agencies. Roadway Maintenance Responsibility data is key to understanding which government agenices are responsible for maintaining public roadways throughout the State of Maryland.Roadway Maintenance Responsibility data is updated and published on an annual (yearly) basis for the prior year. This data is for the year 2017.
