The LBRS establishes partnerships between State and County government for the creation of spatially accurate street centerlines with address ranges and field verified site-specific address locations. Funding to support the development of LBRS compliant systems is available to counties through a Memorandum of Agreement (MOA) that establishes roles and responsibilities for program participation. Participating counties provide project management and QA/QC on road names, addresses, etc to develop data that is compatible with the state's legacy roadway inventory. The Ohio Department of Transportation is the LBRS Program Sponsor, providing technical guidance, support, and QA/QC services. The program is being administered by OGRIP, the state's coordinating body for Geographic Information System (GIS) activities. Through the collaborative efforts of State and Local government the LBRS program is producing highly accurate field verified data that is current, complete, consistent, and accessible. LBRS data is maintained as an Ohio asset by local resources and is provided to the state as part of a coordinated long-term effort by OGRIP to reduce redundant data collection by developing data that meets the needs of several levels of government.

Find more information at http://imap.maryland.gov.The TIGER/Line Files include both incorporated places (legal entities) and census designated places or CDPs (statistical entities). An incorporated place is established to provide governmental functions for a concentration of people as opposed to a minor civil division (MCD), which generally is created to provide services or administer an area without regard, necessarily, to population. Places always nest within a State, but may extend across county and county subdivision boundaries. An incorporated place usually is a city, town, village, or borough, but can have other legal descriptions. CDPs are delineated for the decennial census as the statistical counterparts of incorporated places. CDPs are delineated to provide data for settled concentrations of population that are identifiable by name, but are not legally incorporated under the laws of the State in which they are located. The boundaries for CDPs often are defined in partnership with State, local, and/or tribal officials and usually coincide with visible features or the boundary of an adjacent incorporated place or another legal entity. CDP boundaries often change from one decennial census to the next with changes in the settlement pattern and development; a CDP with the same name as in an earlier census does not necessarily have the same boundary. The only population/housing size requirement for CDPs for the 2010 Census is that they must contain some housing and population. The boundaries of all 2010 Census incorporated places are as of January 1, 2010 as reported through the Census Bureau's Boundary and Annexation Survey (BAS).

The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (Service) is the principal Federal agency that provides information to the public on the extent and status of the Nation's wetlands and provides stewardship for the wetlands data that comprise the Wetlands Layer of the National Spatial Data Infrastructure. In the formulation of this data layer, historic wetlands are defined as areas where there is evidence that a wetland once existed. This evidence can be from historical map information inventories of past wetland extent or other information collected that relate directly to data on wetland filling, drainage or other modifications. Historic wetlands have been identified using several different techniques depending on the availability and type of information used to locate these areas and user needs. For example, historical maps often provide information about past wetland extent or location and can be useful tools to identify historic wetlands. Historic wetlands have been identified as polygonal data. No linear features have been included. Historic wetland polygons are not classified as wetlands and have no wetland labels or attribution. Since these features no longer exist, boundary delineations are considered approximations based on topography, previously mapped information or indications of historic water levels.""",Purdue,State of Indiana,United States Fish and Wildlife Service,Environment|Biota|Geoscientific Information|Inland Waters,English,Dataset,Shapefile,Polygon,2014-10-20,2014,2014,"-88.0157,37.3724,-86.8562,38.5276",Indiana,http://maps.indiana.edu/previewMaps/Hydrology/Wetlands_Historic_NWI.html,http://maps.indiana.edu/download/Hydrology/Wetlands_Historic_NWI.zip,,http://maps.indiana.edu/metadata/Hydrology/Wetlands_Historic_NWI.xml,,,,,,,,

The project area consists of approximately 500 square miles. The project design of the LiDAR data acquisition was developed to support a nominal post spacing of 0.70 meters. Fugro EarthData, Inc. acquired 151 flight lines in eight lifts on February 6, 7, 9, 13, 15, and 16, 2011; in tidal areas, data was collected within 2 hours (before or after) of mean low tide. The data was divided into 1500 by 1500 meter cells that serve as the tiling scheme. LiDAR data collection was performed with a Piper Navajo twin engine aircraft, utilizing a Leica ALS60 MPiA sensor, collecting multiple return x, y, and z as well as intensity data. LiDAR data is remotely sensed high-resolution elevation data collected by an airborne collection platform. This data of the Pocomoke and Atlantic Coastal Watersheds in Maryland, was collected at sufficient resolution to provide a nominal point spacing of 0.70 meters for collected points.

This data product supports Maryland Department of Transportation State Highway Administration (MDOT SHA) leadership and planners as they endeavor to mitigate or prevent the impacts of sea level change resulting from land surface subsidence and rising sea levels.MDOT SHA 2050 Mean Sea Level 0.2% Annual Chance (500YR Storm) - Depth Grid data was produced as a result of efforts by the Maryland Department of Transportation State Highway Administration (MDOT SHA), Eastern Shore Regional GIS Cooperative (ESRGC), Salisbury University (SU), United States Corps of Engineers (USACE), National Oceanic Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), and the United States Geological Survey (USGS). The US Army Corps of Engineers provide the sea level change estimate. Sea level change is localized using water elevations collected from a qualifying National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) tidal reference station - NOAA observations are transformed from tidal datum to North American Vertical Datum of 1988. A final correction for glacial isostatic adjustment and land creates an sea level change value for the official project year, 2050.MDOT SHA 2050 Mean Sea Level 0.2% Annual Chance (500YR Storm) - Depth Grid data was task-based, and will only be updated on an As-Needed basis where necessary.Last Updated: 10/07/2019For additional information, contact the MDOT SHA Geospatial Technologies:Email: GIS@mdot.maryland.govFor information related to the data, visit the Eastern Shore Regional GIS Cooperative (ESRGC) websiteWebsite: https:www.esrgc.org/mapServices/For additional data, visit the MDOT GIS Open Data Portal:Website: https://data.imap.maryland.gov/pages/mdot/For additional information related to the Maryland Department of Transportation (MDOT):Website: https://www.mdot.maryland.gov/For additional information related to the Maryland Department of Transportation State Highway Administration (MDOT SHA):Website: https://www.roads.maryland.gov/Home.aspxMDOT SHA Geospatial Data Legal Disclaimer:The Maryland Department of Transportation State Highway Administration (MDOT SHA) makes no warranty, expressed or implied, as to the use or appropriateness of geospatial data, and there are no warranties of merchantability or fitness for a particular purpose or use.

Project specifications are based on the U.S. Geological Survey National Geospatial Program Base Lidar Specification, Version 1.2. The data was developed based on a horizontal projection/datum of NAD83 (HARN), State Plane, Feet and vertical datum of NAVD88 (GEOID12B), Feet. Lidar data was delivered as processed Classified LAS 1.4 files, formatted to 1,413 individual 4000 ft x 6000 ft tiles, as tiled Intensity Rasters, and as tiled bare-earth DEM; all tiled to the same 4000 ft x 6000 ft schema. Ground Conditions: Lidar was collected in early to mid 2018, while no snow was on the ground and rivers were at or below normal levels. Sensor errors in mulitple locations were identified in processing, additonal acquisition on 7/20/2018 was completed to remedy the errors. 2016 lidar data was used with approval in a single area of restricted airspace. In order to post process the lidar data to meet task order specifications and meet ASPRS vertical accuracy guidelines, Sanborn Map Company, Inc. established a total of 23 ground control points that were used to calibrate the lidar to known ground locations established throughout the project area. An additional 79 independent accuracy check points in Open Terrain and Urban landcovers were used to assess the vertical accuracy of the data.
